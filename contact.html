            <p>The app is a rewarding game. Since there are no right or wrong answers, the children have the freedom
                to continue to do whatever they want without having to think of disappointing anyone.
            </p>
            <p> Without the fear of failure, children learn better and faster. The kids enter an amount for girls
                and boys. They can then guess how much boys and girls their will be total. After they submit,
                the answer will be shown.</p>
            <p> It is recommended that the children start out with lower numbers.</p>
            <p>They can then progressively add on to those numbers.  This game can be replayed an infinite amount
                of times. This will give your little ones a head start against all other children.
                It is recommended that children use this app as young as when they start talking.
                There is no age limit to Education!
